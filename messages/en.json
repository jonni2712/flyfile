      "q1": "How does end-to-end encryption work?",
      "a1": "Every file uploaded to FlyFile is encrypted with AES-256 using a unique automatically generated key. The file is encrypted on our server before being stored and is decrypted only when an authorized user downloads it. This ensures that not even we can access the contents of your files.",
      "q2": "What are the transfer limits?",
      "a2": "Individual file size is unlimited on all plans. The limit concerns the monthly quota: Free (5GB/month), Starter (300GB/month), Pro (500GB/month), Business (unlimited). Each plan also has a monthly transfer limit.",
      "q3": "Are files automatically deleted?",
      "a3": "Yes, all files have an automatic expiration based on your plan: Free (5 days), Starter (7 days), Pro (30 days), Business (1 year). With Pro and Business plans you can customize the expiration. Once expired, files are permanently deleted.",
      "q4": "Can I integrate FlyFile into my systems?",
      "a4": "Yes! With the Business plan you have access to our complete REST API with Bearer Token authentication and webhooks for real-time notifications. Complete documentation is available in the API Reference section of this page.",
      "q5": "Is FlyFile GDPR compliant?",
      "a5": "Yes, FlyFile is fully GDPR compliant and meets other international data protection standards. We have implemented all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data and respect users' rights."
